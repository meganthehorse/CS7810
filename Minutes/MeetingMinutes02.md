# Meeting Minutes

##  Attendees
* Brandon Dave
* Megan Noble
* Ryan Miller 

##  Agenda
2/21/2023:
- Identify primary classes
- Getting key notions from our competency questions

2/23/2023:
- Figure out how to represent trajectory
- Identify patterns which can be used to model key notions
- 

##  Notes/Comments
- Identify a thorough list of key notions. For each key notion, explain your rationale
- For each Key Notion or set of key notions, identify a pattern which can be used to model them, otherwise indicate that there is no existing pattern.
- Draft an instantiation of the pattern (a module) based on your use-case, where possible.
- For key notions with no pattern, draft a module which would model them.
- Connect the key notion to where the data is coming from. So if you have an Event as your keynotion, which piece of your identified datasets are you using to model this.
- Occasionally you will have "controlled vocabularies." These are not really patterns, but just a list of individuals that are important (and will not change). Indicate which key notions behave as such and their list of individuals.

- Please use yEd and the graphical syntax found in other pattern diagrams to draw your schema diagrams.
  - Please place all schema diagram drafts into a folder called `schema-diagrams/`.

- Please put all above written content in a markdown folder called `key-notions.md`.

- Please make sure your final commit with all requested content is completed by 11:59 pm 03/05/23.
