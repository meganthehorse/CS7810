# Meeting Minutes

##  Attendees
* Brandon Dave
* Megan Noble
* Ryan Miller 

##  Agenda
- address Cogan answers to Ryan: https://github.com/meganthehorse/CS7810/issues/15
- PROV-O for trajectory analysis; extrapolate further than AsteroidDistance
    - solution y is from elliptical function f on args a b c
    - fill in self-created excel sheet with above function.  New dataset based on an orbit function 
- schedule/time investment discussion 
- PROV-O of measurable and observable properties
- Find formula to calculate distanceFromEarth
- Dataset

##  Notes/Comments
- Megan (with Brandon support): Formulate personal data that utilizes SBDB data values that can explain "distance calculation".  
    - Orbital Ellipse is Circumference relative to semi major and minor axis measurements.
    - Function to determine "location"?
    - Function to calculate distance from Earth based on "location"?
        - Do we adjust scope to be relative to Sun as point (0,0,0) as it is the center of solar system?
- Ryan:  Data gathering / standardization from SBDB (NASA) and MP3C.  Where are the differences other than a rounding of values? 
- Brandon:  Rough draft of SOSA Patterns into existing schema diagrams
