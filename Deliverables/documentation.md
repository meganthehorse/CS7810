**Authors:** Dave, Brandon Daniel, Miller, Ryan E., Noble, Megan T.

## Use Case Scenario
### Narrative 
The rich minerals on Earth remain a non-renewable resource for humans as they continue to refine the currently available resources to build products from everyday use items to hardware for technological advances. Due to the limited availability of rich minerals, humans will eventually need to branch out from Earth to other planetary bodies for mineral excavations. SOL Of Life plans to support the missions of space exploration and research by providing a tool to query collected data of asteroids within Sol, our solar system. Users of our tool could range anywhere from government entities, researchers, analysts, other space research institutions, and space enthusiasts. 

The available research and data can be cumbersome to navigate through. A knowledge graph is interesting in the case of mining in space because it is an uncharted frontier. There are so many questions that are difficult to answer surrounding the viability and cost. A knowledge graph would provide a method for answering those questions without the need for a specialized analyst to go out and make the various connections themselves from the existing research and data.

Our focus is on asteroids that can be found within approximately 2AU of Earth because of their potential for containing valuable minerals and a wealth of existing data. As defined by NASA, an asteroid exists as a space rock that orbits the sun with a size between 10 meters and 530 kilometers. 

Open source data provided by researchers and institutions such as Neil deGrasse Tyson, NASA, and Space Force, can be re-purposed into a knowledge graph to provide insight into excavation missions. With all of the data gathered together, the knowledge graph helps to filter the information into a readable state. Data that includes celestial body mineralogy predicted from infrared readings combined with data of the bodyâ€™s trajectory path could be used together for humans to plan space missions in order to send out spacecrafts for mining expeditions. We also hope to serve humans of Planet Earth against celestial bodies that may be on a course for impact into the planet.

## Modules

### Asteroid
**Source Pattern:** Feature of Interest  
**Source Data:** Asterank, MP3C, NASA_JPL  

#### Description
The domain of space objects are broken into three subcategories: Artificial Space Objects, Space Weather Phenomena, and Natural Space Objects.  Asteroids exist as a Natural Space Object where object can be further defined as a material object.  An Asteroid is represented by NASA as an object that orbits the sun of the Sol Solar System measuring 33 feet (10 meters) to 329 miles (530 kilometers).  For the SOL of Life, the only celestial body to be concerned with is Asteroid; therefore, the derived understanding begins with an OWL Thing consisting of multiple properties; such as, labeled naming conventions and quantitative measurable components of velocity, semi-major axis, and minimum orbit intersection distance.  Researchers have also predicted properties that benefit exomining operations such as the average profit gained after a mining excavation with consideration of the available valuable materials.  A subsumption is made for Asteroids into Near-Earth Asteroids when their semi-major axis measurement is within a threshold.  The SOSA pattern best reflects the usage of SOL of Life's knowledge graph with respect to the layer of Observations. Asteroids can be represented as a Feature of Interest with a Observations, a Classification, and a Distance Record.

### AsteroidClassification
**Source Pattern:** No Source Pattern  
**Source Data:** Asterank, Asteroid Spectral Types  

#### Description
The derived elemental composition of an Asteroid is a prediction based from infrared readings, as traveling to each individual asteroid remains an unrealistic task. As such, infrared reflections and readings are compared for similarities against known Earth elements and denote the components from the Asteroid's surface. The infrared data has been collected to formulate classifications among clusters of all asteroids for similarities of readings. The infrared readings and cluster family of similar asteroids result in a SMASSII classification which can be represented as a label. For our use case, we're only interested in the asteroid type as a label and decided to disregard the initial observation that lead to the classification.

### DistanceRecord
**Source Pattern:** MODL's Record  
**Source Data:** SkyLive  

#### Description
The end-goal of SOL of Life is to provide insight at a specific point of time for whether an Asteroid is within a means of distance for exomining companies to travel to for mineral extraction operations. As such, the spatial coordinates of an Asteroid is less important than the actual distance from Earth, which acts as a baseline for exomining operations. We used the Record pattern for distance from Earth because it accounts for some Event that occurs at a specific point in time. For our ontology, the Event is simplified as a result for a quantifiable metric for distance from Earth.

Data that describes Asteroids can be represented as Observations from the SOSA pattern which consists of the property that describes the observation along with the quantifiable value. The description of the property follows SOSA's ObservableProperty pattern, and the value follows the aforementioned Result pattern.  With that in mind, the measurable data; such as, mass, value, and velocity are represented as an instance of an Observation.

### Result
**Source Pattern:** MODL's Result and Quantity  
**Source Data:** Asterank, MP3C, NASA_JPL  

#### Description
A Result pattern is used to describe the quantifiable values in the properties of an Asteroid. In our case, the Result notion has a Quantity associated with it, which is a pattern in MODL. A Quantity consists of a Quantity Kind, which is the description indicating the Result's usage, along with the quantifiable value and unit of measurement. Similarly to how controlled vocabularies are used in the Enslaved Ontology, we implement them as a means of scalability of our ontology. They are considered to be separate from the actual ontology yet complement it. A Quantity Kind as controlled vocabulary can consist of, but is not limited to mass, distance from Earth, and velocity. A Unit as controlled vocabulary can consist of, but is not limited to km/s, kg, and AU.
