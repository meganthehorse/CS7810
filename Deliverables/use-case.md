# Narrative
I am summary text.  

1. Who do we support? (NASA? SpaceForce? Drilling Companies?)
2. What are their goals? (Celestial Body Observations? Mineral Composition?)
3. Why is making a KG interesting (or important) for the use-case?

#  Competency Questions
1. What minerals can be found in Apollo Asteroid Belt?  
2. What celestial body will be 0.5 astronomical units away from Earth in the next 24 months?
3. What are the 5 closest celestial bodies that contain iron?
4. What are the 5 celestial bodies within 0.5au of Earth that could result in the most profit?  
5. How long will a celestial body be within 0.5au of Earth?
6. When will a celestial body enter within 0.5au of Earth?
7. When will a celestial body exit a 0.5au range from Earth?
8. What is the travel time to "the asteroid"?
9. What celestial body has the highest confidence of an accurate trajectory?
10. Based on current trajectory, can we accomplish the mining mission in 6 months?
11. How much planning time is available until the celestial body is within 0.5au of Earth?
... etc
