# Narrative
I am summary text.  

1. Who do we support? (NASA? SpaceForce? Drilling Companies?)
2. What are their goals? (Celestial Body Observations? Mineral Composition?)
3. Why is making a KG interesting (or important) for the use-case?

#  Competency Questions
1. What minerals can be found in Apollo Asteroid Belt?
2. What celestial body will be 0.5 astronomical units away from Earth in the next 24 months?
3. What are the 5 closest celestial bodies that contains iron?
4. What are the 5 celestial bodies within 0.5au of Earth that could result in the most profit?5.
