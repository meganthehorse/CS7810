# Critique Assignment
**Author:** Megan Noble

## Group 1: {Airworthiness}
**Members:** Antrea Christou, Erin Rogers, Sydney Woods
### Summary
This group was concerned with determining the airworthiness of an aircraft. They combine the knowledge of parts, the manufacturing companies that made the parts, and crash data. 

### Strengths
1. The limitations of their data and their graph were made very clear.
2. They laid out a good use-case. Antique aircrafts, poor documentation, out of date manuals, etc. is a concerning problem.
3. I liked that the presentation included takeaways from what they learned from their data.

### Weaknesses
1. Existing data from the department of transportation and the FAA is not good, which majorly limits the capabilities of the knowledge graph. I wonder if there's better data from other countries or sources.
2. I'm not sure I see the benefit of using a knowledge graph in this case.
3. There were some decisions in their schema that I would challenge, such as the way they represented subclasses.

## Group 2: {The Driving Project}
**Members:** Jehan Fernando, Christopher Menart, Alexander Moore
### Summary
The use-case of this knowledge graph is to help make decisions for driverless vehicles on the road. The current method is machine learning, which has limitations that a knowledge graph could be suited for. It uses the Cityscapes dataset that contains information about scenarios in an image taken from a vehicle.

### Strengths
1. To my knowledge, it's a novel idea that fills in gaps in current capabilities.
2. The road scenarios seemed to be well thought out and logically sound.
3. The overview was easy to follow and informative with pictures included.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited to Cityscapes data from Germany.
2. A real-world implementation would be very difficult because data would vary greatly by location.
3. I might have chosen different competency questions because some of them are well suited for existing machine learning models. For example, data on local laws that aren't visible on signs at a given time.
