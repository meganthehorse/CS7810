# Critique Assignment
**Author:** Ryan Miller

## Airplane KG
**Members:** Antrea Christou, Erin Rogers, Sydney Woods
### Summary
- Provide a knowledge graph for linking and storing a wide variety of information related to Airplanes.

### Strengths
- Comprehensive list of various significant attributes related to aircraft.
- Appropriate documentation of limitations and setbacks throughout the project.
  - Clearly explained project adaptations that were made after realization of limitations.
- Competency Questions were well written and covered significant aspects of their knowledge graph.

### Weaknesses
- There wasn't a clear use of existing key notion patterns in their schema designs, which lead to some of the key notions coming across as unclear or too modular.
- Use case and background was a bit ambiguous, it wasn't clear if there was more to it than just a database on information related to airplanes.  
- With the lack of available data, the actual format of expected data and how it would be used was left unclear.

## Driving KG
**Members:** Jehan Fernando, Christopher Menart, Alexander Moore 
### Summary
- Provide a knowledge graph framework for rules and regulations related to driving, that assists in automated driving decisions based on rules and relationships in the environment.

### Strengths
- Great set up of background and motivation, it was clearly explained why the knowledge graph is different from existing automated driving research and how it differs from existing self-driving reasoning techniques.
- Good explanation of the available data, how it was used, how it could be used.
  - Documentation of limitations related to data availability.
- Schema design was very thorough, relationships and notions were well thought out and edge cases were covered extensively along with comprehensive axioms for the relationships.

### Weaknesses 
- Converting an AI/ML + Sensors based problem area into a knowledge graph made for competency questions that did not showcase well how exactly the knowledge graph could be used.
  - The competency questions focused more on scenario analysis instead of assisting with rules and regulations.
  - Questions on analysis of the environment seem like questions that could be more easily answered by an existing sensors system rather than knowledge graph.
